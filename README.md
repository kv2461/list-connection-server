# [List Connection](https://github.com/kv2461/list-connection)

 
 
[Sparrowhood](https://github.com/kv2461/list-connection) is a social media website for lists meant for recommendations, ranking, or regular list sharing. It allows users to create, find, and update lists. Data for each individual list is obtained from a 3rd party APIs for accessible autocomplete. The idea was inspired by President Obama's summer reading posts on Instagram. The idea being that users can be led by another user they follow to different/new things they might enjoy through peer to peer recommendations and exposure. Because it is a person they respect in other aspects of life, the recommendations become more enticing based on user familiarity between past user content.

## Code Highlights
  * All list data was return by the different 3rd party API call in a javascript object so could not be easily organized. By creating components that rendered different content based on data structure, the data could keep proper specificity without making front end overly redundant.
